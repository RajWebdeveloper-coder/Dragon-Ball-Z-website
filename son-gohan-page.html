            <p class="text-gray-200 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Gohan, the eldest son of Goku and Chi-Chi, possesses an **inherent, massive power level** that often surpasses his father's when fully unleashed. Despite this incredible potential, his passion lies in academia, fulfilling his mother's dream of him becoming a scholar. Mentored primarily by Piccolo, he represents a unique blend of Saiyan strength, human emotion, and Namekian discipline. He is most famous for unlocking the **Super Saiyan 2** form during the Cell Games and later achieving his **Ultimate (Mystic) Form**, showcasing that his power is unlocked through inner potential, not just transformation.
